THIS IS OUT OF DATE

This is a set of Evergreen and OpenSRF cookbooks for use with Chef (http://www.opscode.com/chef), a Ruby-based configuration management tool.

This package is beta quality.  It is not recommended for those who are not familiar with the OpenSRF/Evergreen installation process.

These cookbooks can also be used with Vagrant, a tool which deploys VMs using VirtualBox (http://www.vagrantup.com)

The Evergreen packages work ok with 1.6.1 but you may need to tweak the opensrf.xml templates.


CHEF SOLO USAGE:

1.  Follow the chef installation instructions: http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Installation

2.  Create a solo.rb config file: http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Chef+Solo

3.  Use dna.json.example as a starting point for the chef json config file 


VAGRANT USAGE:

1.  Install vagrant (http://www.vagrantup.com)

    gem install vagrant

2.  Download a base box, I have tested with the following:

    vagrant box add lucid32 http://files.vagrantup.com/lucid32.box

3.  Install git

    ie: sudo apt-get install git-core

4.  Clone the cookbook repo:

    git clone git://github.com/jamesrf/evergreen-chef.git

5.  Create a new vagrant instance using the 'vagrant init' command (see Vagrant help for more info)

6.  Modify Vagrantfile.example to suit your needs and put it in your new vagrant instance

7.  Run vagrant up to load and provision the VM
